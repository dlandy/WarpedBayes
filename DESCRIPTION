Description: This package implements psychophysical transformations (and their inverses) and the normal-normal "vanilla" bayesian estimation procedure, in functions that easily chain through piping. It makes it easy to generate and fit models, while viewing them as minor variations on a general theme: transformation from bounded to unbounded spaces along with simple Bayesian logic. 
Depends: R (>= 3.3.3)
